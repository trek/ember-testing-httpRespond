# Deprecated

The underlying API in Ember.js this library used is gone and unlikely to return.

The last release of this helper is [0.2.0](https://github.com/trek/pretender/tree/0.2.0) and will
work with Ember `1.0` to `~1.3`, but will not work with Ember `>= 1.4.0`.

I'd recommend using [Pretender](https://github.com/trek/pretender) for versions of Ember.js `>= 1.4.0`.
